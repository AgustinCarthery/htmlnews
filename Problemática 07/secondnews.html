                    Michael Kraus, who is the administrator of the Silver Lakes Specialized Care Center in Staten Island, told

                    on Thursday that his staff were also 'petrified' about the nursing home order that was issued March

                    Cuomo has come under intense scrutiny over his nursing home COVID-19 response after he barred nursing 
                    homes from rejecting recovering 
                    <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank"">coronavirus</a>
                    patients being discharged from hospitals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some nursing homes complained at the time that the policy could help spread the virus. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kraus said he immediately flagged his concerns in a conference call with health officials after 
                    learning about the order.

                    Many facilities vocalized it. They were petrified but they were more petrified of the Department of Health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I did vocalize it but once it was shot down, I never spoke again,</q> he said.

                <p>
                    Kraus defiantly shut down his nursing home for 10 weeks and refused to accept patients, despite 
                    pressure from local hospitals who were overwhelmed with surging COVID cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He claims some hospitals threatened to report them for non-compliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cuomo eventually rescinded his nursing home order in May and insisted on a negative COVID test 
                    instead before return to a nursing home. By that point, however, more than 9,000 people had already 
                    returned to nursing homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kraus said his facility ended up reporting two COVID deaths, six off-site deaths and 37 probable deaths.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At least 15,000 nursing home residents in New York state have died of COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cuomo has repeatedly tried to deflect criticism that his administration hadn't done enough to protect 
                    nursing home residents from the virus and, more recently, has been accused of under-counting the deaths.

                        Attorney General Letitia James released a report finding that New York under-reported the number 
                        of deaths among nursing home patients by around 50 per cent, with 13,000 actually dying - not 
                        the 8,500 reported.

                        Melissa DeRosa, Cuomo's secretary, admits that in August they 'froze' when asked for nursing 
                        home data, and dragged their heels on releasing it. The AP reports that more than 9,000 people 
                        were returned to nursing homes to recover from COVID in the period March 25-May 10, a figure 40 
                        per cent higher than the official tally.

                    It has since emerged that his top advisers successfully pushed the state's health officials to strip 
                    a public report of data that showed more nursing-home residents had died of COVID-19 than acknowledged 
                    by the administration.
                </P>
                <P>
                    About a third of the state's nursing home fatalities were excluded from the report as a result of 
                    the change.
                </P>
                <p>
                    State officials insisted earlier this month that the edits were made because of concerns about accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The administration refused for months to release more complete data. A court order and state attorney 
                    general report in January forced the state to acknowledge the nursing home resident death toll was 
                    higher than the count previously made public.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The state now acknowledges that at least 15,000 long-term care residents died, compared to a figure 
                    of 8,700 it had publicized as of late January that didn't include residents who died after being 
                    transferred to hospitals.

                    Mike Lawler, a Republican assemblyman representing Rockland County, has been among those calling 
                    for Cuomo to resign over the nursing home scandal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>It’s very clear the Cuomo admin understood their March 25th order had contributed to the death toll 
                    & they wanted to cover it up to avoid political fallout, plain and simple,</q> he tweeted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>They had the data & they hid it. This was a coordinated criminal conspiracy to obstruct justice.</q>

                    New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez called for a 'full investigation' into Cuomo's handling of 
                    COVID-19 in nursing homes
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>I support our state's return to co-equal governance and stand with our local officials calling for 
                    a full investigation of the Cuomo administration's handling of nursing homes during COVID-19,</q> she 
                    said in a statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers lost their lives in nursing homes throughout the pandemic. 
                    Their loved ones and the public deserve answers and transparency from their elected leadership, and 
                    the Secretary to the Governor's remarks warrant a full investigation.</q>
